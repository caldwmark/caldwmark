- 👋 Hi, I’m Mark
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Design and Docker, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Next, Sanity, and Sass 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects
- 📫 How to reach me ... coming soon

I'm kinda starting to get a handle on things here!

The pinned repos are not broken as of this writing.  Beyond there, you're on your own.  I will do some purging soon, 
keeping only the good ones. Good luck!
